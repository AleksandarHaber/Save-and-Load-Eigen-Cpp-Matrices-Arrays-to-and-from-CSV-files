# Save-and-Load-Eigen-Cpp-Matrices-Arrays-to-and-from-CSV-files
The functions provided in this C++ source files are used to save and load Eigen C++ matrices/arrays to and from CSV values. The post accompanying these codes is provided here:

The motivation for developing these function stems from the fact that the Eigen C++ matrix library does not contain functions for saving and loading objects to and from files. These functions are a part of a more complex project I am working on.
